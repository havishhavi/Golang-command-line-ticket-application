//Example of switch statement 
// based on the city user selected, particular code block is executed 
// switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values

//in switch statement we can consolidate multiple values and execute a same login for both the values

city := "London"

switch city {
    case "New York":
        code for booking ny tickets
    case "Singapore":
        code for booking Singapore tickets
    case "Hyderabad":
        code for Hyderabad
    // if code block is same for mexico and usa then include both cities in one case
    case "mexico", "usa":
        code for both mexico and usa
    //default handles the case if no match found
    default:
        no valid city selected 
        // default is like else in if else statement
